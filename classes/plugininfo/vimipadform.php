 * Subplugin info for the vimipadform (diagram form / display type) type.

 * type declared in db/subplugins.json. Each vimipadform_* subplugin contributes
 * one display type (its shapes, connector style and bifurcation); they carry no
 * admin settings and are managed as part of the parent activity, so this info
 * class only needs to permit uninstallation.
